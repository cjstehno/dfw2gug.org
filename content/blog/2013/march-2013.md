In lieu of a speaker, this month's meeting will feature a pair of videos from Robert C. Martin. They are the first two from his "Clean Code" video series, available at http://www.cleancoders.com. We are paying for the community license, so we encourage your participation. As the community licenses are not exactly inexpensive, donations/sponsorships gladly accepted. Feedback and donations will play a large part in whether or not we continue the series :)

After the videos, we'll have an open discussion. We can discuss the videos, or anything else. If anyone has a short presentation (5-30 minutes) we'd love to hear from you about that as well.

Please remember, we are always looking for speakers and topics. If you want to present to the group, please don't hesitate to contact one of the group organizers. If you want to see a topic covered, let us know, and we'll do what we can to either get a speaker or cover it ourselves!
