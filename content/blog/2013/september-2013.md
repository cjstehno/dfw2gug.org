## Abstract

AST Transformations are becoming more important with each new release of Groovy. For example, most of the new features in the 2.1 release of Groovy involve [AST Transformations](http://groovy.codehaus.org/Groovy+2.1+release+notes). But, most Groovy users are not aware of what they do and how to go about writing one themselves. This presentation will (hopefully) help you do both. We'll cover what an AST is, how to transform one, and why this is useful. Learning more about AST transformations, even if you never write one yourself, make Groovy a much more powerful and versatile language in your hands.
