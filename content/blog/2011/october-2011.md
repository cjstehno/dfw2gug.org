## Abstract

This is a project and technology comparative review of a commercial grade Groovy / Grails application that replaced Struts in a .gov domain.

Reviewing some design and code, as appropriate, the emphasis is on "Lessons Learned", so you can advocate Groovy and Grails, as a design win vs. traditional Java EE approaches.

We will cover the project starting point, goals, approach, technology decisions, development experience and project results. We will also learn a bit about leveraging the Amazon cloud on this project.
