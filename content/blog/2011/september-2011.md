## Abstract

The September meeting will be a continuation of our August meeting. We will spend a few minutes in the beginning of the meeting getting newcomers caught up, and refreshing attendees from last month on where we left off.

Grails is a Groovy-based, rapid-application development platform for building web and web-service applications that run on the JVM.

This session will be very "hands-on". Please bring your laptop and plan to "learn while doing." I will start with a high-level intro to Grails, and then we will start building a demo application. By the time we are done you will have built custom domain objects, controllers, gsps, services and tag libraries.

This hands-on workshop will be spread over two months, August and September.
