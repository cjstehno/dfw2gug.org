## Abstract

Database migrations are an important facet of web development. When an application is in production and the customer requests incremental changes to the database, the development team must have a rock solid plan to preserve the existing data while seamlessly adding new functionality and tables. Without a tool to manage database migrations, teams rely on manual sql, error prone communica-tion processes, and costly risk management to im-plement solutions. This presentation will cover the Grails Database Migration Plugin, the official plugin created by Spring Source which is based on the pop-ular Liquibase framework. With live examples, we will demonstrate how database migrations can be controlled, managed, and executed.
