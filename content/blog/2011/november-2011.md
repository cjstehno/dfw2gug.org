## Abstract

Database migrations are an important facet of web development. When an application is in production and the customer requests incremental changes to the database, the development team must have a rock solid plan to preserve the existing data while seamlessly adding new functionality and tables. Without a tool to manage database migrations, teams rely on manual sql, error prone communication processes, and costly risk management to implement solutions. This presentation will cover the Grails Database Migration Plugin, the official plugin created by Spring Source which is based on the popular [Liquibase](http://liquibase.org) framework. With live examples, we will demonstrate how database migrations can be controlled, managed, and executed.
