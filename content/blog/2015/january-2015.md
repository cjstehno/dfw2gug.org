## Abstract

This presentation will focus on using the Netflix Availability Open Source Stack in a Grails environment. George will produce a fully distributed, highly available, application using Grails and Hystrix for micro-services.

Though all of the services will be run locally, George will demonstrate how they can be scaled individually and load tested using the Groovy Console. He will also demonstrate the use of the Netflix Turbine dashboard for monitoring all of the different services.

## Bio

George Smith has been a software developer and architect for more years than he would like to count. For the past 5 years he has worked as a developer and architect for BNSF Railway. He introduced Groovy to BNSF, through the use of Spock Testing, and Gradle for building systems. Many DevOps concepts such as Continuous Integration, Binary Repositories (Artifactory), Immutable Infrastructure, and Continuous Deployment came next. Recently he introduced BNSF Railway to Grails. He has been concentrating on using a distributed micro-service architecture for his recent work.
