## Abstract

Most tools, technologies, and processes focus on improving source code, application design, application architecture, etc. What is missing in all of this is managing the creation and migration of databases. This is ironic since the database is typically much more valuable to a company than are the applications and databases almost always outlive applications designed for them. We will cover managing database migrations using simple, yet powerful tools: Flyway, Gradle, Groovy, and Git.
