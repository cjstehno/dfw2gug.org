## Abstract

In [March](march-2012.html), we had the opportunity to learn the basics of Scala. This month we will dig deeper into Scala through an introduction to the [Lift web framework](http://liftweb.net). Lift is a "View First" web framework, inspired by the Apache Wicket framework. It favors convention over configuration and packages into a war file that can be deployed in your favorite servlet engine. This presentation will focus on creating a basic Lift site. Attendees will learn to initialize a project, work with the Mapper ORM, create browser views and RESTful services. Finally, we will touch on AJAX and Comet integration
