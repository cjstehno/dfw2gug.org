## Abstract

In March, we had the opportunity to learn the basics of Scala. This month we will dig deeper into Scala through an introduction to the Lift web framework. Lift is a "View First" web framework, inspired by the Apache Wicket framework. It favors convention over configuration and packages into a war file that can be deployed in your favorite servlet engine. This presentation will focus on creating a basic Lift site. Attendees will learn to initialize a project, work with the Mapper ORM, create browser views and RESTful services. Finally, we will touch on AJAX and Comet integration
