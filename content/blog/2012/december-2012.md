## Abstract

December's Groovy User's Group meeting will focus on multi-threading and concurrency in groovy. The presentation will focus on two areas: 1) Tools standard Groovy gives to make multi-threaded programming easier and less error prone and 2) The [GPars]http://gpars.codehaus.org) framework which simplifies making common programming tasks concurrent. The presentation will be code and audience driven. If you don't even know how to launch a new thread in groovy, we can cover that. If you are a multi-threading maniac and want to talk about the inner workings of JDK 7's Fork/Join framework, we can cover that too. Please bring your laptop for playing with and using the code [samples](https://github.com/dwclark/GroovyThreading). It's best if you have JDK 7 and Groovy 2 installed, but a lot of the examples will run with little to no modifications with lower versions.
