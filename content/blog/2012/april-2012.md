Enter Twitter Bootstrap. Bootstrap is an open source project created by the guys and girls from Twitter that brings together a best-practices based CSS which incorporates user interface components and a grid layout. Combined, these make it easy for non-designers to create consistent, responsive, and, dare say, good looking websites for our users. This talk with cover the basics of Bootstrap and how to make use of it in a Grails application, including layout and some of the core widgets
