## Abstract

Developing tests is expensive, but so are broken web apps. Less expensive and broader functional tests can help to find the right balance for your projects. We will explore ways to make functional testing of web applications less expensive and more robust by leveraging the interactive Groovy console for rapid test development, advanced page abstraction techniques with Geb, and automated report generation with Spock.
