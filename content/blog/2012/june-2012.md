## Abstract

Quickly prototyping apps is becoming more important every day, but sharing those prototypes can be difficult when they only exist on your laptop. June's talk will cover how to get a [Grails](http://grails.org) app quickly setup on [Heroku](http://heroku.com), why you might or might not want to, and workflow imposed by the platform.

We'll cover the basics of git/git-flow/github, postgresql, heroku, pgadmin3, and more. We'll be doing some hands on stuff, so be sure to have both a heroku account, and a github account setup before you come so you can follow along.
