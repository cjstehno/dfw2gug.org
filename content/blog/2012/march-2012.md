## Abstract

Scala is a general purpose programming language, smoothly integrating object-oriented and functional paradigms. Code compiles down to Java compatible byte code and runs on the JVM. It has become the foundation for high transaction organizations such as Twitter and FourSquare.

This presentation will focus on introducing attendees to the high level concepts of Scala. We will focus on basic object/class structures, functional concepts and integrating with Java. The goal of the presentation is to encourage attendees to experiment with Scala and to provide a platform upon which to compare and contrast different JVM based languages.
