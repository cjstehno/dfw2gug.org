Happy New Year! No meeting this month, but we have Steve Goode talking about Ratpack in February and Chris Stehno talking about the Spring Boot Remote Shell in March.

We need topics and presenters. If you want a topic covered or want to be a presenter please let us know so we can get something on the schedule for this year.
