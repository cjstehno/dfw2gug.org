## Abstract 

[Gradle](http://gradle.org/) is a flexible and powerful build system that you have probably heard of but may have never really used; it can seem a bit unapproachable starting off. We will work through some Groovy-based examples of getting started with Gradle and how to hit the ground running and doing some real work.
