## Abstract 

At the [June JavaMug meeting](http://www.javamug.org/meeting/11), Dave Thomas said “Object-Oriented Programming is Dead!” and Functional Programming is gaining popularity.  So what is Functional Programming and how can we use it with Groovy.   Groovy is not a pure functional language, we can use it in a functional style.
