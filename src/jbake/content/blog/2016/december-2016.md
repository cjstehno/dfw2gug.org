## Abstract 

Last month we had an overview of [Gradle](http://gradle.org/). This month we delve deeper in and talk about how and why to develop Gradle plugins by developing a simple one during the meeting. 

If you missed last month's meeting you can read a great blog post from Chris that covers the same [Intro to Gradle](http://coffeaelectronica.com/blog/2016/gradle-introduction.html) material he covered in the meeting.
