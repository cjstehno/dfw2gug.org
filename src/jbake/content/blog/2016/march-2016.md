## Abstract 

Do you ever find yourself wanting simple shell access to your running application? Sure, Grails has the Groovy Shell, but you haven't seen anything yet. The [CRaSH](http://www.crashub.org/) shell embedded in Spring Boot provides a rich embedded shell environment in your application with all the features you need. This talk will cover how to setup the shell and how to write your own shell commands so you can increase the visibility and control over your application.
