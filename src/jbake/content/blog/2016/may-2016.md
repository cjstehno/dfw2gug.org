## Abstract 

We do not have a speaker for May so we are going to watch a webcast delivered by Ken Kousen, Seriously, Use Groovy NOW. We can stop the video during the meeting and discuss the material or just discuss at the end. I'll let the group decide.

This webcast will be great for Java engineers interested in Groovy as it does a good job highlighting Groovy's easy of use and powerful language features.

No need to bring popcorn because we will have pizza and soda avaialbe.
