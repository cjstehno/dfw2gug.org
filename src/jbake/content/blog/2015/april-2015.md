## Abstract 

Microservices Architecture is currently on the rage with developers. As developers move to The Cloud and Scale their applications, the Monolithic approach is falling short. Microservices bring a better approach for developing these types of applications but it also introduces new problems. This talk will cover Microservice Architecture and how to develop them using Spring Boot + Groovy.
