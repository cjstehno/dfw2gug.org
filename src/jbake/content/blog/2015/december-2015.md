## Abstract
A focal point of the 2015 Spring One 2GX Conference was centered on the cloud, and specifically Cloud Foundry.   One barrier to introduction for small teams is that Cloud Foundry has been a bit of an all or nothing proposition until now. The goal of Lattice is to be convenient and accessible to developer-produced infrastructure components that are small enough to be deployed on a laptop, but capable of scaling to manage resilient cloud native applications on any infrastructure.  Join Dave Shuck as we walk through the basics of Lattice.
