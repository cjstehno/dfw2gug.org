## Abstract 

This presentation will discuss the newly-released [version 3 of the Grails framework](http://grails.github.io/grails-doc/3.0.x/guide/introduction.html). For those new to the framework, all the basics will be included, like domain classes, controllers, and services. For experienced developers, the new Gradle-based build system will be examined, as well as application profiles. Also included will be demonstrations of RESTful web services and testing, including the new functional testing capabilities.
