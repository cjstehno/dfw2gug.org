[George Smith](https://github.com/george-smith) has been a software developer and architect for more years than he would like to count. For the past 5 years he has worked as a developer and architect for BNSF Railway. He introduced Groovy to BNSF, through the use of Spock Testing, and Gradle for building systems. Many DevOps concepts such as Continuous Integration, Binary Repositories (Artifactory), Immutable Infrastructure, and Continuous Deployment came next. Recently he introduced BNSF Railway to Grails. He has been concentrating on using a distributed micro-service architecture for his recent work.
