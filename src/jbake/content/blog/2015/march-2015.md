Well, dang the crazy Dallas winter weather. We are going to postpone Andrew Rubalcaba's talk on Microservices with Spring Boot and Groovy until April.

Andrew and I talked and rather then have people fighting the predicted freezing rain and sleet, and all that that means on the Dallas roads. Or, having people skip and miss his great talk to avoid the roads. We are just going to push this out until April. Stay safe and warm.
