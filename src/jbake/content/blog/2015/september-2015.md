## Abstract 

Ever wanted to have a blog of your very own, but didn't want to deal with hosting providers or someone else owning your content data? GitHub-Pages provide a great way to serve up your blog content for free and JBake gives you the tools you need to make content management painless. This talk will show you how it's done, which is also how it was done for the DFW Groovy & Grails User Group web site.

## Materials

The slides from the presentation are available for [download](/downloads/JBake_Presentation.pdf).
