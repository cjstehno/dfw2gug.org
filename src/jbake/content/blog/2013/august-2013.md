## Abstract

A circuit breaker is a way to control mis-behaving code. Our breaker will protect our system by limiting the number of exceptions code will throw.
We're going to build a circuit breaker into a grails plugin. Our plugin will be published on git hub. We will use [travis-ci.org](http://www.travis-ci.org) to provide continuous integration
