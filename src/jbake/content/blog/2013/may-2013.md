This month we will be watching the following video presentation: "[Smarter Testing with Spock](http://vimeo.com/33947244)" by Peter Niederwieser. We will then discuss the content and talk about future meeting topics.

Please remember, we are always looking for speakers and topics. If you want to present to the group, please don't hesitate to contact one of the group organizers. If you want to see a topic covered, let us know, and we'll do what we can to either get a speaker or cover it ourselves!
