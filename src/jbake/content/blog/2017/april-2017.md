## Abstract

Over the past 10 years I have been moving companies towards Groovy. Sometimes this was the first time the company had used Groovy, at others it was a re-introduction after a bad experience with Groovy. We'll talk about the projects where I was able to use Groovy, how I sold Groovy, and what happened to those projects. Then we'll talk about what I learned and give some tips on selling your boss on Groovy (or any new JVM technology). I'm also hoping to hear your stories, both successes and failures, in how you have introduced new technologies (especially Groovy!) to the companies you work for.
