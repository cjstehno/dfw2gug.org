## Abstract

While writing tests for the HttpBuilder-NG project, I uncovered a need for a more flexible server endpoint mocking library, so I created [Ersatz](http://stehno.com/ersatz/). In this talk I will go over a basic introduction to the library and its primary features.

Afterwards, we will discuss and plan our meetings for the rest of the year.
