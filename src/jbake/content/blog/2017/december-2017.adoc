~~~~~~

We ran out of speakers so there is no meeting this month.

Also, our Meetup.com account is expiring in a few days and will most likely be shutdown - $10/month is $10/month more than
out meeting buget allows, especially when it's not really brining in new members. An email will go out to the membership group
if/when it is cancelled.

The group meetings will still continue with this web site, as they always have.

Happy Holidays!
