## Abstract

The dynamic features of the Groovy programming language enable you to effortlessly change behavior at runtime, intercept methods, and execute dynamic code without writing reams of code. We explore how these features are leveraged by Grails (to implement dynamic Hibernate finders, Builders, etc.) or how you could use it for your apps. Groovy, baby!
